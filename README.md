COS-126 Final Project, groupchat text simulation and data analytics using Markov Model

This project takes in a file of text messages from a groupchat. After cleaning the data and separating by person, we simulate a conversation using a Markov Model to predict groups of consecutive words in the groupchat based on the most commonly said word groups for each individual, in addition to displaying analytics like most common word per person, and person who speaks most in the groupchat.
