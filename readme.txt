Our project takes in a file of text messages downloaded from imessage, cleans the data into
arrays of each individual personâ€™s texts in the groupchat and removes unnecessary elements
like (time/date or other imessage extra symbols). We then simulate a conversation between
two people by finding key sentences in the text file, and then implement it into the markov
model. Finally, we perform a data analysis on the frequency of words / people that talked
the most in the group and display that in a bar graph.
